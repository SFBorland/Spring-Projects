**Sample E-Commerce Application (Monolith by design)**

Somewhat older single monolith/appServer-like Spring Boot application that   
uses Spring-MVC, RestTemplate, Hibernate, MySQL, JDBC, JdbcTemplate,  
cache, session, cookie, Thymeleaf and Spring Security.

The idea is to get all the "older" technologies down mostly for reference. Maybe  
one day an even older JEE based JBOSS app or something will be created to have even older stuff.
